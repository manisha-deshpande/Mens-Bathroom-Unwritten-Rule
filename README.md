# Mens-Bathroom-Unwritten-Rule
 
Author: Manisha Malhar Rao Deshpande
  
This is a maven-java project.
 
--------------------------
About:

This project addresses the unspoken rule that in a men's urinal, there are no two adjacent users. The input is a sequence of 0's and optional 1's, where 0 represents an unused urinal and 1 represents a urinal being used. 
<br>
The code returns the number of urinals left that can be used, such that the unwritten rule is followed (no adjacency).
<br>
For invalid inputs, the code returns -1.
<br>
Each line of the src/main/resources/urinal.dat input file represents an input.
<br>
The result of each input is stored on a new line in a newly generated rule.txt output file.
